# Geonode Workshop
A basic geonode project, for educational purposes and local tests.

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your OS, then just run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/geosolutions-it/geonode-workshop.git
cd geonode-workshop
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

:tea: Take a cup of tea, and relax. The build and startup will take some time.

:clock1: In a few minutes your local GeoNode will be visible at [http://localhost](http://localhost)

You can adapt the .env file if you want to change the default secrets and configuration.
